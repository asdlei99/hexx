# CHANGELOG

## [Unreleased]

* Added `Hex::xrange` for excluding range coordinates (#88)
* Implemented  `PartialEq` For `HexOrientation` (#87)
* `HexOrientation` is now a two variant enum instead of a struct:
  * The inner data (matrices and rotation) are now retrievable through either:
    * `orientation_data()` method
    * `Deref` implementation
* Added conversion from angles for both `Direction` and `DiagonalDirection` (#92):
  * `Direction::from_angle`
  * `Direction::from_pointy_angle`
  * `Direction::from_flat_angle`
  * `Direction::from_angle_degrees`
  * `Direction::from_pointy_angle_degrees`
  * `Direction::from_flat_angle_degrees`
  * `DiagonalDirection::from_angle`
  * `DiagonalDirection::from_pointy_angle`
  * `DiagonalDirection::from_flat_angle`
  * `DiagonalDirection::from_angle_degrees`
  * `DiagonalDirection::from_pointy_angle_degrees`
  * `DiagonalDirection::from_flat_angle_degrees`
* Added missing `Direction::angle_degrees` method (#92)
* Added missing `DiagonalDirection::angle_degrees` method (#92)
* Added `UvOptions` for both planet and column mesh builder (#93):
  * `mesh_builder` example now uses a checker texture and showcases uv options
  * `ColumnMeshBuilder` has uv options for cap and side faces
* (**BREAKING**) All functions that previously required a borrowed `&HexOrientation`
now take an owned `HexOrientation` as the type is now `Copy` (#95)
* (**BREAKING**) Removed all functions deprecated in `0.6.0`(#94)
* Fixed `a_star` algorithm giving inconsisten paths (#96)
* Bumped `glam` dependency to 0.24

## 0.6.0

* Changed logo (#63)
* Drop `itertools` dependency (#58)
* (**BREAKING**) Removed deprecated `Hex::directions_to` method (#58)
* Added `MeshInfo::facing` utils method to rotate hex meshes (#65)
* Added `hex` utils function to create an `Hex`, making it less boilerplate (#66):
  * Before: `Hex::new()`
  * Now: `hex()`
* `Hex` won't derive `Debug` or `Hash` on spirv archs (#66)
* Added `packed` feature to make `Hex` `repr(C)` (#67)
* Added an `algorithms` module with a `a_star` implementation (#69)
* Added field of view algorithms in `algorithms`:
  * `range_fov` omni-directional field of view
  * `directional_fov` directional 120 degrees field of view (`Direction`)
* Added field of movement algorithm in `algorithms`:
  * `field_of_movement` provides the available range of field of movement given
  a `budget` of movement and a movement `cost`
* Renamed rotation functions to follow `cw`/`ccw` terminology
(old versions deprecated) (#78)

### Directions to

The *direction_to* functions were reworked to avoid a
edge case where on some coordinates two directions can be valid (a *tie*).

* Added new `DirectionWay` type
* Added `Hex::way_to` which returns a `DirectionWay<Direction>`
* Added `Hex::diagonal_way_to` which returns a `DirectionWay<DiagonalDirection>`
* Deprecated `Hex::direction_to` in favor of `way_to`
* Deprecated `Hex::diagonal_to` in favor of `diagonal_way_to`

This type can represent the classic *Single* case (One direction) or the *Tie*. This may
seem like an over complication, but `DirectionWay<T>` implements `PartialEq<T>`, which means
you can still do this:

```rust
let a = hex(1, 0);
let b = hex(43, 12);
if a.way_to(b) == Direction::Top {
    //
}
```

But now with accurate results !

* Deprecated `MeshInfo::hexagonal_column` and `MeshInfo::partial_hexagonal_column`
* (**BREAKING**) `MeshInfo` fields use `glam` types instead of arrays of float
* Added `ColumnMeshBuilder` to create hex column meshes. This allows more customization options than the previous way:
  * Rotation
  * Offset
  * Sides subdivisions
* Added `PlaneMeshBuilder` to create hex plane meshes. This allows more customization options than the previous way:
  * Rotation
  * Offset
* (**BREAKING**) Removed `MeshInfo::facing` method.
* Added `MeshInfo::rotated` method
* Added `MeshInfo::with_offset` method
* Added `MeshInfo::merge_with` method to merge two meshes

### Examples
